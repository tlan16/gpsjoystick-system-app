This installed gps joystick as system app. 

Note if you are on Android 13 or above, this may not work as expected.

Alternative is using `LSPosed` and `Hide Mock Location`, which you can use any app to mock the location (with developer options set), but app won't be able to detect it. This way also avoids the handling of system app and its permissions.
